    "Question 1: What is Simple Linear Regression (SLR)? Explain its purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables: a single independent variable (predictor) and a single dependent variable (target). It assumes that there is a linear relationship between these two variables, meaning the data points can be approximated by a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** The primary purpose of SLR is to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the value of the independent variable and to understand the nature of the relationship (positive or negative correlation) between them."

    "\n",
    "1. Linearity: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear.\n",
    "2. Independence: The observations are independent of each other (residuals should not be correlated).\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals (errors) is constant across all levels of the independent variable.\n",
    "4. Normality: The residuals of the model are normally distributed."

By collecting historical data on current employees, a simple linear regression model can be fitted to estimate the expected salary for a candidate with a specific number of years of experience."

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "The method of least squares (Ordinary Least Squares or OLS) is an optimization technique used to find the best-fitting line for the data. It works by minimizing the sum of the squared vertical differences (residuals) between the observed data points and the values predicted by the linear approximation. By minimizing this sum of squared errors, the method determines the optimal values for the intercept and slope."

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "R-squared (R^2), also known as the Coefficient of Determination, measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). It ranges from 0 to 1. An R^2 of 1 indicates the model perfectly explains the variability of the target data, while 0 indicates it explains none of the variability. It is essentially a measure of \"goodness of fit.\""
