    "Q: What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Compiled languages are translated directly into machine code that the processor can execute. This translation process, done by a compiler, happens before the program is run. As a result, compiled programs tend to be faster. Examples include C, C++, and Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreted languages, like Python, are not directly compiled into machine code. Instead, an interpreter reads and executes the code line by line at runtime. This makes them more platform-independent and easier to debug, but often slower than compiled languages."

Instead of letting the program crash, we can use constructs like try...except blocks to catch these exceptions and execute specific code to handle them gracefully."

While it can be used for cleanup tasks, its use is generally discouraged because the exact timing of its execution is unpredictable. The with statement and finally blocks are preferred for resource management."
